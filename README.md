# JR Data Scientist - Skill Test
# Introduction
This repository is about showing data science skills for solving one of the most important problems that companies face: Customer churn. The dataset used is from the Kaggle IBM Sample: Telco Customer Churn. This dataset contains contains customer related information like demographic, services a user has, billing type, payment type, and the most important, if the customer has left the company. Under this scenario, and with the objective of generating a predictive model for customer churn, the notebook called "JR Data Scientist - Skill Test.ipynb" contains the whole data science project. From data loading and data exporation till model evaluation.

Please find below the outline of contents of such notebook.

# Running the notebook

The "JR Data Scientist - Skill Test" has a direct Google colab link so the entire code can be reproduced by using already installed libraries in such environment. However, if using a different method, the versions for the libraries used are as follows:

- Pandas: 1.1.5
- Numpy: 1.19.5
- Matplotlib: 3.2.2
- Seaborn: 0.11.2
- Scipy: 1.4.1
